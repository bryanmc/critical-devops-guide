# Video Content Creation

A's an entrepreneur online, you will more than likely be required to create some kind of video content one day.  Whether that be instructional videos, promotional videos or anywhere in between, you will need to be able to do this efficiently and with as little cost as possible.  That is precisely what this section of the guide covers - my experience as a nearly "one man gang" and getting the best possible result from my video content without spending thousands on video editors \(the people\) or video editors \(the software / tools\).

## Cloud-Based Editing

If you are working from a Chromebook, you won't immediately have access to the usual power tools that you'll find on Mac OS or Windows.  But thanks to our good friend progressive web development, there are apps like Moovly which perform admirably and allow you to create unlimited video content for $5/mo.

* Moovly - cloud-based video editor on par with some of the more advanced mac/windows editors

## Video Creation Assets

To create videos, especially sales videos, you will need a good source of stock video footage.

* VideoBlocks - annual one-time fee of $200 for unlimited downloads and royalty free, commercial use of thousands of videos.  What's cool is that these are also accessible via Moovly to import directly into your projects.

## Asset Hacks

For when you are strapped and need assets for high quality production.  Use at your own risk.  Never distribute a project widely where assets were attained by these or similar tactics:

### Quality Cinema Music

1\) Go to a site like this: [https://www.rocketstock.com/after-effects-templates/video-slideshows/projector/](https://www.rocketstock.com/after-effects-templates/video-slideshows/projector/)

2\) Get the Chrome extension here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recordrtc/ndcljioonkecdnaaihodjgiliohngojp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recordrtc/ndcljioonkecdnaaihodjgiliohngojp)

3\) Start the recorder \(check its options to make sure it's recording  ONLY the tab audio\)

4\) Finish recording and save the webm file \(does automatically\)

5\) Use [http://cloudconvert.com](http://cloudconvert.com) to convert it to an mp3 or wave
